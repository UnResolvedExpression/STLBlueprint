	//in the program lets render all the triangle edges that intersect the saggital plane. Then users can click them to grey them out for making the blueprint.
	// perhaps a brush size for doing that
	// we will need a seperate clicking library...
	//y is forward, z is up, x is toward us
	//triangles that do not intersect or are not very close - .5 block (we can do the later later on maybe) are not drawn
	//everything is in the positve octant
	//	but maybe that is stl 1.0 since these look to be negative as well. Nonzero though
	//xyz
	//lets not worry about the slice for now and just draw the edges.
	//we will want a class maybe, with all the info as well as whether it is too far (bool) or hidden (bool)
	//might be best to finsh chapters up to 17 of learncpp
